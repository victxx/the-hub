# THE HUB: Interactive Web3 Gaming Platform

## Project Overview

**THE HUB** is an interactive gaming platform built on Web3 that allows creators to distribute interactive text-adventure games as digital collectibles. Users can browse available games, purchase them using CAMP tokens, and play them through an immersive retro-themed interface.

## Contract Addresses

- Base Camp Testnet: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`
- Scroll Sepolia: `0x8A791620dd6260079BF849Dc5567aDC3F2FdC318`
- Arbitrum (Coming Soon)
- Mantle (Coming Soon)

## What Problem Does It Solve?

THE HUB addresses several key challenges in the gaming and creative industries:

1. **Creator Monetization**: Enables game writers and creators to directly monetize their interactive narratives without relying on traditional publishing gatekeepers.

2. **Digital Ownership**: Provides true ownership of digital content, allowing users to own the games they purchase as verifiable digital assets.

3. **Distribution Platform**: Offers a dedicated platform for text-based adventure games, a genre that often lacks specialized distribution channels.

4. **Community Building**: Creates a space for creators and players to connect through interactive storytelling experiences.

## Alignment with Camp's Mission

THE HUB strongly aligns with Camp's mission of creator ownership and fair AI in several ways:

1. **Creator Ownership**: 
   - Creators receive 90% of sales from their games
   - Smart contracts ensure transparent revenue distribution
   - Creators maintain IP rights while monetizing through the platform

2. **Fair AI Integration**:
   - AI is used to enhance storytelling, not replace creators
   - The platform supports human creators first, with AI as a complementary tool
   - Our approach maintains the human creative element while leveraging technological advantages

3. **Community Governance**:
   - Future development includes community voting on featured content
   - Plans for DAO-based governance where creators and players have input on platform decisions
